/**
 `InlineTask` provides interface for creating asynchronous taks that don't
 neccesarily finish with result. To create `InlineTask` you pass a closure to
 the initializer.
 
 ```swift
 let task = InlineTask {
 doWork()
 }
 ```
 
 Inline tasks behave same as any `Task<T>`. They can be added to the
 `TaskQueue` and you can use `onComplete(_:)` method to be notified when they
 are finished with execution.
 
 - Note: `InlineTask` is most commonly used in UI interactions. For example,
 you can create `InlineTask` that presents view controller and add dependency
 task that retrieves data from the server.
