/**
 `Task<T>` is an abstract class that provides interface encapsuling any
 asynchronous or synchronous operation. Abstract nature of the `Task<T>` enforces
 you to create a subclass for any task you want to create. Subclassing `Task<T>`
 is simple operation. You are only required to override `run()` method that
 defines task execution point and call `finish(_:)` method to finish execution.
 In order to execute any task you need to add it to the `TaskQueue` which
 manages task execution, concurrency and threading mechanisms.
 
 `Task` also provides method chaining and completion blocks that are executed
 depending on the task result. It also features retry mechanisms for tasks
 which finished with errors.
 
 There are several key aspects of the `Task<T>` that you need to understand:
 
 1. **State machine** - `Task<T>` works with internal task state machine. State
 of the task at any point can be:
 
	* Initialized - Task instance is created
	* Pending - Task is added to the `TaskQueue` and started process of
	evaluating readiness
	* Ready - Task is ready to execute.
	* Executing - Task is executing
	* Finished - Task finished with execution
 
 2. **Task execution point** - Task execution starts in `run()` method when state
 reaches `Ready` state. You should always override this method in your subclass.
 
 3. **Finishing execution** - Task execution finishes when `finish(_:)` method is
 called. You always finish execution with `Result<T>` object. `Result<T>` is an
 enum with two cases:
 
	* `Value(T)`
	* `Error(ErrorType)`
 
 After `finish(_:)` method is called, you can access result through `result`
 property.
 
 - note: You can access `result` object from any thread.
 
 **Example subclass**
 
 ```swift
 class SomeTask: Task<Int> {
     override func run() {
         asyncOperation { data, error in
             if error != nil {
                finish(.Error(error!))
             } else {
                finish(.Value(data as! Int))
             }
         }
     }
 }
 
 let queue = TaskQueue()
 let task = SomeTask()
 queue.addTask(task)
 ```
 
 ### **Completion blocks**
 ---
 You can use one of the defined completion blocks that are executed when task
 finished with execution.
 
 1. `onValue` - executed when task finishes with `Value(T)`
 2. `onError` - executed when task finishes with `Error(ErrorType)`
 
 ```swift
 let task = SomeTask()
 
 task
    .onValue { value in
        print(value)
    }.onError { error in
        print(error)
 }
 ```
 
 - note: Many of the `Task` methods can be chained to enable simple setup
 
 - warning: Calling `onValue` and `onError` methods after the task is added
 to the `TaskQueue` may result in error, since the task may have already finished
 with execution. To avoid this behaviour, always call these methods before task
 is added to the `TaskQueue`.
 
 ### **Dependencies**
 ---
 
 Complex tasks should be always divided into several smaller tasks. To make sure
 that tasks are executed in the correct order you can use dependencies. To add
 dependency use `addDependency(_:)` method.
 
 ```swift
 let task = SomeTask()
 let otherTask = OtherTask()
 
 task.addDependency(otherTask)
 ```
 
 When task with dependencies is added to the `TaskQueue`, dependencies will be
 executed first.
 
 - note: You can access all task dependencies with `dependencies` property.
 
 ### **Conditions**
 ---
 
 In some cases, tasks need conditions to be satisfed in order to be executed.
 
 One example would be location retrieval. In order to get location from the
 device you need to make sure that user granted permissions for location
 services. Granting permissions can be exposed as task condition. You can create conditions using `TaskCondition` protocol and add them to the task by using
 `addCondition(_:)` method.
 
 ### **Observers**
 ---
 
 In addition to the `onValue` and `onError` completion methods, you can use
 `TaskObserver` protocol to be notified when task starts and finishes with
 execution.
 
 Classic example would be creating observer that manages `UIActivityIndicator`
 based on the task execution state.
 
 ### **Retry**
 ---
 
 If the task finishes execution with error, it's execution can be retried. To
 specify maximum number of retry operations use `retry(_:)` method.
 
 ```swift
 let task = SomeTask()
 
 task
    .retry(3)
    .onValue { value in
        print(value)
    }.onError { error in
        print(error)
    }
 ```
 
 - note: `retry(_:)` method can be chained with other task methods
